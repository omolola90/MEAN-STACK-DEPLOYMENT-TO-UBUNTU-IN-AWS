# What is mean stack?
The MEAN stack is a software stack—that is, a set of the technology layers that make up a modern application—that’s built entirely in JavaScript. MEAN represents the arrival of JavaScript as a “full-stack development” language, running everything in an application from front end to back end. Each of the initials in MEAN stands for a component in the stack:

# MongoDB: A database server that is queried using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and that stores data structures in a binary JSON format

# Express: A server-side JavaScript framework

# Angular: A client-side JavaScript framework

# Node.js: A JavaScript runtime


This framework comes as an alternative to the widely known LAMP stack, which uses JS on the client side, but PHP on the server side.
